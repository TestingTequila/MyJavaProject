1. What are variables
2. How do we create variables in Java
    a) dataType variableName = value;  [The value we want to store is responsible for deciding the data type]

    b)  dataType variableName;
        variableName = value;

    Data Types:
    Primitive Data Types: [byte, short, int, long], (float, double)], char, boolean
     we know in advance how much memory it will consume
     we don't need objects to use primitive data types

    Non-Primitive Data Types: String, Arrays....etc
     we don't know in advance how much memory it will consume
     we need objects to use primitive data types

     Criteria to Select Data Type [32766]
       -mathematical Calculations [ignore byte/short data types]
       -Check Range
       -Check least memory consuming data type
