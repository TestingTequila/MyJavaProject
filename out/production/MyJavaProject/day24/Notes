OOPs Concepts:
-method Overloading: In a class we can have two or more methods with the same name, provided
                     their signatures are different

                     How to make signature different
                     i)   by changing the data type of parameters
                     ii)  by changing the order of data types of parameters
                     iii) by changing the count of parameters

 Method overloading happens within the same class
