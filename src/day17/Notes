Loops: Repetitive Tasks

1. while loop
    define a variable
    while(apply condition over variable)
    {
       action performed if condition is true;
       I/D operator;
    }
2. for loop

        for(define a variable ; apply condition over variable;I/D operator)
        {
           action performed if condition is true;

        }

3. advanced for loop [for each loop]
   for(DataTypeOfGroup aliasName: NameOfTheGroup)
   {
       action
   }
